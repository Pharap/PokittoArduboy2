# avr-libc replica

A replica of the [avr-libc library](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/index.html) created by [Pharap](https://github.com/Pharap) for [Pokitto](https://www.pokitto.com/).

## Licence

The original code uses the BSD 3-clause licence.
Although none of the original code is used, the original API is copied, hence the original licence still stands.

Note that although this library mimics the API of avr-libc, it is an incomplete replica and does not use any of avr-libc's original code, and as such many of the copyright notices included in the licence file may not apply, but are included anyway for the sake of completeness.
